## About Design patterns
Designs patterns were found to solve problems and weren't invented.
They apply OO basics and OO principles.

### OO basics
- Abstractions
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism
- Inheritance

### OO principles
- Encapsulate what varies
- Favor composition over inheritance
- Program to interfaces, not implementations
- Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
- Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification
- Depend on abstractions. Do not depend on concrete classes
- Talk only to your friends
- Don't call us, we will call you.
- A class have only one reason to change
